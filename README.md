# OL3Designer
A crude  winforms app to aid creation of openlayers 3 maps

The  designer takes GIS data (ie. .shp/.tab/.kml etc) and produces simple interactive maps without the need for any code. It handles both the javascript and a crude customizable layout to position dynamic map legends, images, text etc...

There are some examples of what the application in its current state can do here:

The application is currently unfinished but core features do work dispite being very buggy in places.  
It was designed to take the bulk of the work out of creating an OL3 map.  while it will create a working map, it will need some tidying up to make it look 100% presentable.  The maps it exports are completely 'client side' and have no need for any server infrastructure, only an internet connection is required if you choose to use an OSM background.
